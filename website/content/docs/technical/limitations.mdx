translate-kit is still in beta. It handles around 95% of a typical codebase's translatable content — that's already a lot of tedious work off your plate, but the remaining 5% still needs manual supervision.

## Patterns Not Yet Supported

The scanner extracts strings from JSX text, attributes, expression containers, object properties, template literals, and conditional expressions. However, some patterns are beyond its current reach:

- **Strings in variables and constants** — `const title = "Welcome"` won't be detected unless it's used directly in JSX
- **Non-JSX files** — strings in plain `.ts` files (API responses, error messages, etc.) aren't scanned

For these cases, add the keys manually to your source locale JSON and translate-kit will translate them along with everything else.

## Framework Support

- **Currently supported**: next-intl + Next.js
- Other i18n libraries and frameworks are not yet supported, though the core pipeline (scan, codegen, translate) is framework-agnostic by design

## AI Limitations

- **Plurals and gender** — basic handling only. Complex ICU MessageFormat patterns need manual authoring
- **Context boundaries** — the AI receives project context and namespace information, but very nuanced domain-specific terms may need glossary entries
- **Large batches** — very large codebases benefit from adjusting `batchSize` and `concurrency` settings

## Roadmap

- Close the remaining gap — support strings in variables and non-JSX files
- Support other i18n runtimes and frameworks beyond next-intl
- Translation memory across projects
- Better handling of plurals and gender-specific translations
- Per-route lazy loading of namespaces
