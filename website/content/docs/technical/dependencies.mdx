translate-kit is not a runtime dependency of your project. It generates standard code and JSON files. If you remove it, your app keeps working exactly the same.

## Runtime Dependencies

These are the packages translate-kit uses internally when you run its commands:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| `ai` (Vercel AI SDK) | `generateObject` with Zod schemas for all AI calls (key generation and translation) |
| `@babel/parser` | Parse JSX/TSX source code into AST |
| `@babel/traverse` | Walk and analyze the AST to find translatable strings |
| `@babel/generator` | Generate modified source code from the transformed AST |
| `@babel/types` | AST node builders and type guards |
| `c12` | Config file loading — supports `.ts`, `.js`, `.json` formats |
| `zod` | Config validation and AI response schemas |
| `citty` | CLI command framework with subcommands and flags |
| `@clack/prompts` | Interactive terminal prompts for the `init` wizard |
| `picocolors` | Terminal color output |
| `dotenv` | Environment variable loading (for API keys) |
| `tinyglobby` | File pattern matching for the scanner's include/exclude globs |
| `p-limit` | Concurrency limiter for parallel AI batch processing |
| `tokenlens` | Token counting for AI batch size estimation |

## Peer Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| `ai` (>=4.0.0) | Required — provides the AI model interface |

## What Gets Installed in Your Project

translate-kit generates code that depends on:

- **Keys mode**: `next-intl` — installed automatically by the `init` wizard
- **Inline mode**: no external runtime dependency — the generated `<T>` component is self-contained

The AI provider SDK (e.g. `@ai-sdk/openai`) is the only additional dependency you install alongside translate-kit itself.
