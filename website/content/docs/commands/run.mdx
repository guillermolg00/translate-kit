title: run
description: Run the full pipeline in one command.
---

The `run` command executes the full pipeline: scan, codegen, and translate — in one step.

## Usage

```bash
translate-kit run
```

## Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--dry-run` | Preview without writing files |
| `--force` | Ignore translation cache, re-translate everything |
| `--verbose` | Show detailed output |

## What It Does

1. **Scans** source files for translatable strings and generates semantic keys (same as [`scan`](/docs/commands/scan))
2. **Replaces** strings with i18n calls and injects imports (same as [`codegen`](/docs/commands/codegen))
3. **Translates** to all target locales, only sending new/modified keys (same as [`translate`](/docs/commands/translate))

## When to Use

- After initial setup with [`init`](/docs/commands/init)
- When you've added or modified translatable strings in your source code
- As a single command in CI/CD pipelines

## Difference with Individual Commands

`run` passes data directly between steps without intermediate file reads, making it slightly more efficient than running each command separately. It's the recommended way to execute the full pipeline.

## Examples

```bash
# Full pipeline
translate-kit run

# Preview what would change
translate-kit run --dry-run

# Force re-translate everything
translate-kit run --force

# See detailed output
translate-kit run --verbose
```
