## What is translate-kit?

In 2026, manually writing i18n JSON files key by key is obsolete. AI handles translation now, but ad-hoc prompts create inconsistent results across files. translate-kit is a single tool that handles the entire translation pipeline at build time, powered by AI, with zero runtime cost.

It extracts translatable strings from your JSX/TSX, generates semantic keys with AI, replaces hardcoded text with i18n calls, and translates everything to your target locales — using your own AI models via [Vercel AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/). Compatible with [next-intl](https://next-intl.dev/).

## What Makes It Different

- **Build-time, not runtime** — translation happens before you ship. No client-side SDK, no loading spinners, no runtime overhead. The output is static JSON files that next-intl serves directly.
- **Zero dependency footprint** — translate-kit is not a runtime dependency. It generates standard next-intl code and JSON files. If you remove translate-kit tomorrow, your app keeps working exactly the same.
- **AI-native, provider-agnostic** — works with any AI model from any provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Mistral, Groq). The AI receives full context: project description, glossary, tone, namespace structure.
- **Incremental by default** — a lock file tracks SHA-256 hashes. Only changed keys get sent to the AI on re-runs, keeping costs predictable and API calls fast.
- **Scanner understands code** — parses your AST, distinguishes user-facing text from code artifacts, and filters automatically. No manual string extraction.

## How It Works

translate-kit provides a three-step pipeline:

```
scan → codegen → translate
```

1. **Scan** — parse JSX/TSX files, extract translatable strings, generate semantic keys via AI
2. **Codegen** — replace hardcoded strings with `t("key")` calls or `<T id="key">text</T>` components
3. **Translate** — diff source messages against a lock file, translate only new/modified keys

You can use any step independently or run the full pipeline with [`translate-kit run`](/docs/commands/run). The `translate` command is the most commonly used on its own — write your source messages manually and let translate-kit handle the rest.

## Two Modes

- **Keys mode** (default) — strings replaced with `t("key")` calls, source text moves to JSON files. Works with next-intl's `useTranslations`.
- **Inline mode** — strings wrapped with `<T id="key">text</T>`, source text stays visible in your code. See the [Inline Mode guide](/docs/guides/inline-mode).

## Incremental by Default

A `.translate-lock.json` file tracks source hashes so re-runs only translate what changed. This keeps API calls fast and costs low.
